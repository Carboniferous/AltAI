AltAI - An additional AI for Civ IV.

Adds the ability for some/all players (incl. barbs) to use a new AI.
Implemented in parallel with existing AI which remains unchanged.

Currently has separate worker AI, new city placement, plot selection, building, unit and tech selection.

Enhancements include logic to calculate SubAreas (splits Areas into regions which are passable/impassable) 
and (Non)-Irrigatable based on connectivity to water and ability of plots to chain irrigation. Unit path finding 
logic extended to evaluating road building cost and cost of irrigation chains.

Unit path logic takes into account other nearby unit groups and can coordinate moves including attacks from multiple plots

To-dos include explanding basic city build and tech selection logic, implement civic selection, war planning.
