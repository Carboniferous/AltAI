AltAI - An additional AI for Civ IV.

Does not change the default AI - adds the ability for some/all players (incl. barbs) to use a new AI.

ALTAI currently has separate worker AI, new city placement, plot selection, building, unit and tech selection.

Still very much in an alpha state. (No national wonders, spies, missionaries, minimal navy and no air units). 
Diplomacy and unit movement (except workers, settlers and their escorts) still controlled by original logic.
